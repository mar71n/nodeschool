# INTRODUCTION
To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.
Run this command to make a directory called ```javascripting``` (or something else if you like):

```mkdir javascripting```

Change directory into the ```javascripting``` folder:

```cd javascripting```

Create a file named ```introduction.js```:
```touch introduction.js``` or if you're on windows, ```type NUL > introduction.js```
Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

``` javascript
console.log('hello');
```
Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```javascripting verify introduction.js```
