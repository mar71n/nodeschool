# Installing

You have to install `electron` into your command line environment.

Run `npm install electron -g`

If you receive an EACCES error read this guide:

# Hello World

Let's set up a simple electron application.

First, create a new empty folder and do the rest of these steps inside that new folder.

Using a text editor (such as TextEdit, Notepad, etc.), create a file called `index.html` in the folder you just created with the following contents:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Then create a file (in the same folder) called `app.js` with the following contents:

```
var electron = require('electron')

electron.app.on('ready', function () {
  var mainWindow = new electron.BrowserWindow({width: 600, height: 800})
  mainWindow.loadURL('file://' + __dirname + '/index.html')
})
```

Finally, run `electron app.js` in your terminal. You should see an application open that displays Hello World!

# Cat Picture

Now that we have a working skeleton structure we can add our first feature: render a cat picture.

We could write the code to do this ourselves, but (like many other common programming tasks) somebody else has already written code to do this for us. Node.js provides a way for authors to package up chunks of pre-written code for easy re-use, and also provides a program called `npm` to produce, download, and install such packages (which Node refers to as "modules"). If you're familiar with R, `npm` is very similar to the `install.packages()` command.

So, back to our task: add a glorious cat picture to our app. To do this we can use a module from npmjs.org called `cat-picture`. It does one thing: adds a cat picture to a web page.

We will use the `npm` command line tool to download and install the `cat-picture` module. Before we can work with modules, though, we need to give Node a little bit more information about what we are doing with our app. The best way to do this is actually to _create our own_ module!

To do this, all we need to do is create a file called `package.json` that will contain certain information about our module, notably including a list of what other modules we depend on. `npm` can do this for us!

Run the command `npm init` It will ask you some questions to fill out; if you're not sure about the answer, you can just hit "enter" to accept its default.

When the command is complete, you should see a new file in your directory called `package.json`. Check it out! You can open `package.json` in your text editor. 

Now, run the following command: `npm install cat-picture --save`

This will download the `cat-picture` module into a folder called `node_modules` and will also add cat-picture to your `package.json`. If you open `package.json` in your editor again, you should see a mention of the `cat-picture` module.

Now that we have installed the module, we can use it in our application. Add this to your `index.html` file, inside the `<body>` section but _after_ the `<h1>` section:
  
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
```

Then, use your text editor to create a new file in your directory called `index.js` with this line of code in it:

```
require('cat-picture')
```

Now when you run your app with `electron app.js` you should see a cat!

# Cat Annotation

Now we're going to add a feature: draw polygon regions on the image!

This could be useful for labeling objects or defining regions on a map.

Add the following line to the `<body>` section of your `index.html`, which adds an empty `div` element to hold our visualization. **Make sure** this comes **before** the `<script>` tag so that the code runs after the `div` is created.

```
<div id='visualization'></div>
```

Next modify `index.js`. The first line should require our cat picture, and also assign it to a variable:

```
var picture = require('cat-picture')
```

We actually just want the source data for the picture, so get it, then remove the image from the page.

```
var src = picture.src
picture.remove()
```

Now install a visualization module for drawing polygons by typing `npm install lightning-image-poly --save`.

Double check that your `package.json` has a new entry!

Require the module by adding the line:

```
var image = require('lightning-image-poly')
```

Then render the image data we stored above by creating a new `image` visualization.

```
var viz = new image('#visualization', null, [src], {hullAlgorithm: 'convex'})
```

If you run `electron app.js` you should see a cat, and be able to draw polygons on it with the mouse!
